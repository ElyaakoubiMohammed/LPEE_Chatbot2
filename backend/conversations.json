So, here's the deal:\n\nFirst off, we got this thing called 5, that's our base number, right? Now, we need to find out how many times it takes that 5 to make 5 more times itself. Get what I'm sayin'?\n\nSo, let's see... if we have 5, and we keep adding 5 over and over again until we have 25 (cause that's 5 times 5), how many times did we add the 5 to get there?\n\nTo find out, we subtract our starting point (5) from our final goal (25). And if you do the math, you'll see it takes 20 more times of adding 5 to reach 25. So, P is 20. That's your product, partner. Boom!"
